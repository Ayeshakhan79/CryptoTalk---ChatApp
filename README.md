**Usage**

1. Start the Server
python server.py

2. Start the Client
python client.py

Each client generates RSA keys and an AES session key.
Clients exchange public keys to securely share AES keys.
All messages are AES-encrypted before being sent to the server.

**Security Notes**

Uses AES-256-CBC for message encryption.
AES session keys are exchanged securely using RSA-2048.
Each client has its own RSA key pair.
Messages are encrypted end-to-end, the server only forwards encrypted data.
